# Media Report simplifier

**Version 2.0!** Probably has loads of bugs.

This tool makes creating media reports for the [Wikimedia Foundation](https://wikimediafoundation.org/) easier. Hopefully.

If you don't know what a media report is, don't fret! They're not really that interesting to most people.

Thanks to James for providing a server for the PHP side of this, handled (pretty sloppily) with Ajax in the code.
